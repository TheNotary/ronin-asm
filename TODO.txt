== TODO:

=== Ronin ASM 0.1.0:

* Refactor the ASM DSL:
  * It should behave like the other Ronin DSLs:
    * Provide a SymbolTable.
    * Provide access to the generated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
  * It should allow the remapping of used registers.
  * It should be able to output ATT syntax.

=== Ronin ASM 0.1.1:

* It should be able to work with Metasm and GAS.

=== Ronn ASM 0.2.0:

* Fork Metasm and clean up their code, so that it can be packaged as a
  RubyGem and hosted on rubyforge.org.
