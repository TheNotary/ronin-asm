== TODO:

=== Ronin ASM 0.1.0:

* Look into integrating with Wilson, the x86 ruby assembler, available on
  rubyforge as a RubyGem with documentation.
* Refactor the ASM DSL:
  * It should behave like the other Ronin DSLs:
    * Provide a SymbolTable.
    * Provide access to the generated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
  * It should allow the remapping of used registers.
  * It should be able to output ATT syntax.
