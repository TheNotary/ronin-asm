== TODO:

* Refactor the ASM DSL:
  * It should behave like the other Ronin DSLs:
    * Provide a SymbolTable.
    * Provide access to the generated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
  * It should allow the remapping of used registers.
  * It should be able to output ATT syntax.
  * It should be able to work with Metasm and GAS.
* Fork Metasm and clean up their code, so that it can be packaged as a
  RubyGem and hosted on rubyforge.org.
